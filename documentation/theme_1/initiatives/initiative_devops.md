##  Initiative: Implement a Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline for Web of Class Project

Objective: Streamline the development, testing, and deployment process to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and increase the speed of delivering new features and functionality.

## Epics:

[Choose a CI/CD tool: Research and choose a CI/CD tool that is suitable for the project. Consider factors such as cost, ease of use, integration with other tools, and support for the project's specific technology stack.](/documentation/theme_1/initiatives/epics/epic_cicd_tool.md)

[Configure the pipeline: Configure the pipeline to trigger builds and deployments automatically whenever new code is committed to the repository. This will ensure that changes are tested and deployed quickly and consistently.](/documentation/theme_1/initiatives/epics/epic_test.md)

[Implement version control: Set up a version control system such as Git to manage the code and track changes over time.](epics/epic_version_control.md)

## Test plan
* Unit Testing: Developers should write automated unit tests for their code. These tests should be run automatically during the build process.

* Integration Testing: Integration testing should be performed to ensure that the software modules can work together as expected. This includes testing the interactions between the different components of the CI/CD system.

* Functional Testing: Functional testing should be performed to ensure that the software meets the requirements and specifications. This includes testing the software's functionality, usability, and performance.

* Regression Testing: Regression testing should be performed to ensure that changes made to the software do not negatively impact existing functionality. This includes testing for compatibility with different environments, browsers, and devices.

* Security Testing: Security testing should be performed to ensure that the software is secure and does not contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

* User Acceptance Testing (UAT): UAT should be performed to ensure that the software meets the expectations and requirements of the end users. This includes testing the software's usability, functionality, and user experience.

* Performance Testing: Performance testing should be performed to ensure that the software can handle expected load and stress. This includes testing for response times, concurrency, and throughput.

## Testing Tools:

* Jenkins: Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is commonly used for CI/CD. It can be configured to run various testing tools and generate reports.

* Selenium: Selenium is an open-source testing framework for web applications. It can be used for functional testing, regression testing, and performance testing.

* JMeter: JMeter is an open-source tool for load testing and performance testing of web applications.

* OWASP ZAP: OWASP ZAP is an open-source tool for security testing of web applications.

# Initiative: Content management 

## Objective: The objective of this initiative is to ensure that the web application has an effective content management system that enables easy creation, management, and publication of content on the website. The initiative includes several epics that will be completed to achieve this objective.


## Epics 

* Develop a Content Strategy: The first epic will involve developing a content strategy that will guide the creation, management, and publication of content on the website. This will involve identifying the target audience, their needs, and the type of content that will be published on the website.

Design the Content Management System: The second epic will involve designing the content management system that will be used to create, manage, and publish content on the website. This will involve selecting a content management system that is appropriate for the needs of the website and customizing it to meet the specific requirements of the project.

Implement the Content Management System: The third epic will involve implementing the content management system and integrating it with the website. This will involve setting up the content management system on a server and configuring it to work with the website.

[Train Content Creators: The fourth epic will involve training content creators on how to use the content management system. This will involve developing training materials, conducting training sessions, and providing ongoing support to ensure that content creators can effectively use the system.](epics/epic_contents_provider.md)

Implement Content Workflow: The fifth epic will involve implementing a content workflow that will ensure that content is reviewed and approved before it is published on the website. This will involve setting up a workflow in the content management system that includes roles and responsibilities, approval processes, and notifications.

Monitor and Improve Content: The sixth epic will involve monitoring and improving the content on the website. This will involve analyzing user behavior, feedback, and performance metrics to identify areas for improvement and making changes to the content as needed.

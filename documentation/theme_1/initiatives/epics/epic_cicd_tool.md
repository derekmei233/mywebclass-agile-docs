# Epic: Implement Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) for Web of Class Project

## Objective: To establish a seamless and automated workflow for building, testing, and deploying the web application in a controlled and scalable manner.

## Tasks:

* Choose a CI/CD tool: Research and select a CI/CD tool that fits the project's needs and budget. Evaluate tools based on factors such as compatibility with the project's tech stack, ease of use, scalability, and support for automation and integrations.

* Set up a build pipeline: Configure a build pipeline that integrates the source code repository, build server, and artifact repository. Define the build steps, including code compilation, testing, and packaging.

* Set up a test pipeline: Configure a test pipeline that includes unit tests, integration tests, and automated acceptance tests. Ensure that the tests are automated, reliable, and well-documented.

* Set up a deployment pipeline: Configure a deployment pipeline that delivers the application to various environments, such as development, staging, and production. Use tools such as containerization and configuration management to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

* implement security and compliance checks: Incorporate security and compliance checks at each stage of the CI/CD pipeline. Use tools such as vulnerability scanners, code analysis, and access controls to ensure that the application meets security and regulatory requirements.

* Establish monitoring and feedback mechanisms: Implement monitoring and feedback mechanisms to detect and report errors, performance issues, and user feedback. Use tools such as logging, metrics, and feedback channels to provide insights and improve the application's quality.

* By implementing a CI/CD pipeline, the web of class project can benefit from a streamlined and automated workflow, improved code quality, reduced time-to-market, and better collaboration among team members. This epic will require close coordination among developers, testers, DevOps engineers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the pipeline is efficient, reliable, and adaptable to changing requirements.

## Test plan
* Branching and Merging Testing: Branching and merging testing will be performed to ensure that branching and merging operations work as expected and do not cause any data loss.

* User Access and Permissions Testing: User access and permissions testing will be performed to ensure that users can access the version control system and perform operations based on their permissions.

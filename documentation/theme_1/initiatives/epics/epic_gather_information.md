## Objective: To gather relevant information about the web of class project's target audience, their needs, and their expectations to inform the design and development of the web page.

## Tasks:


* Define user requirements and preferences: Gather user requirements and preferences through surveys, interviews, or user testing. Identify the target audience, their needs, and their expectations from the web page. Use this information to inform the design decisions.

* Develop a design strategy and style guide: Develop a design strategy and style guide that defines the overall look and feel of the web page. Determine the color scheme, typography, layout, and visual elements that best represent the project's brand and appeal to the target audience. Ensure that the design strategy and style guide are well-documented and communicated to the team.(epics/epic_gather_information.md)

* Create wireframes and prototypes: Create wireframes and prototypes that translate the design strategy and style guide into actionable visual representations. Use tools such as Figma or Adobe XD to create wireframes and prototypes that showcase the layout, navigation, and functionality of the web page. Get feedback from stakeholders and users and iterate the design until it meets the project's requirements and user needs.

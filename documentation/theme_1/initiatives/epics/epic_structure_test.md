# Epic:Epic Name: Structure Testing

## Objective: The purpose of this epic is to ensure the structural integrity and stability of the web application. The epic includes a series of tests that will be performed to ensure that the application functions as expected and meets the specified requirements.


## User Stories:

As a QA tester, I want to perform unit tests on each component of the web application to ensure that it functions correctly.

As a QA tester, I want to perform integration tests to ensure that all components of the web application work together as expected.

As a QA tester, I want to perform regression tests to ensure that changes made to the web application do not negatively impact existing functionality.

As a QA tester, I want to perform stress tests to ensure that the web application can handle expected load and stress.

As a QA tester, I want to perform security tests to ensure that the web application is secure and does not contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

As a QA tester, I want to perform accessibility tests to ensure that the web application is accessible to users with disabilities.

As a QA tester, I want to perform cross-browser and cross-device testing to ensure that the web application works correctly on different browsers and devices.

## Acceptance Criteria:

All unit tests must pass before integration testing can begin.

All integration tests must pass before regression testing can begin.

All regression tests must pass before the web application can be released to production.

Stress tests must show that the web application can handle expected load and stress without issues.

Security tests must show that the web application is secure and does not contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.


## Test plan 
* Accessibility tests must show that the web application is accessible to users with disabilities.

* Cross-browser and cross-device testing must show that the web application works correctly on different browsers and devices.

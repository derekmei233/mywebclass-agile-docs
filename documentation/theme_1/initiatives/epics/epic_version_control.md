# Epic:Implement Version Control for Web of Class Project

## Objective: To establish a version control system that enables efficient and collaborative software development, code management, and code reuse.

## Tasks:

* Choose a version control system: Research and select a version control system that fits the project's needs and budget. Evaluate systems based on factors such as compatibility with the project's tech stack, ease of use, scalability, and support for collaboration and branching strategies.

* Set up a repository structure: Set up a repository structure that organizes the project's code and assets in a logical and scalable way. Define the branching and merging strategies, such as trunk-based development or feature branching, and ensure that they are well-documented and communicated to the team.

* Establish access controls and permissions: Establish access controls and permissions that ensure that only authorized team members can access and modify the code and assets. Define the roles and responsibilities, such as developers, testers, and reviewers, and ensure that they are well-defined and communicated to the team.

* Implement version control practices: Implement version control practices that ensure that the code and assets are well-managed, tracked, and documented. Use tools such as commit messages, code reviews, and pull requests to improve the code quality and collaboration among team members.

* Ensure code reuse and modularity: Ensure that the code and assets are designed for reuse and modularity by following principles such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion). Use tools such as package managers and libraries to facilitate code reuse and modularity.

* Ensure scalability and backup: Ensure that the version control system is scalable and can handle large amounts of code and assets. Use tools such as backups and replication to ensure that the code and assets are protected and can be restored in case of disasters.

## Test plan

* Installation Testing: Installation testing will be performed to ensure that the version control system is installed correctly and functions as expected.

* Configuration Testing: Configuration testing will be performed to ensure that the version control system is configured correctly and functions as expected.


* Security Testing: Security testing will be performed to ensure that the version control system is secure and does not contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

* Backup and Recovery Testing: Backup and recovery testing will be performed to ensure that backups can be performed and that data can be recovered in case of any data loss.

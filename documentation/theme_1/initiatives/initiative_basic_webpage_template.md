# Initiative: Web Page Design for Web of Class Project


## To design an intuitive and visually appealing web page that meets the project's requirements and user needs.


## Epics 

* [Define user requirements and preferences: Gather user requirements and preferences through surveys, interviews, or user testing. Identify the target audience, their needs, and their expectations from the web page. Use this information to inform the design decisions.](epics/epic_gather_information.md)

<!-- * Develop a design strategy and style guide: Develop a design strategy and style guide that defines the overall look and feel of the web page. Determine the color scheme, typography, layout, and visual elements that best represent the project's brand and appeal to the target audience. Ensure that the design strategy and style guide are well-documented and communicated to the team.(epics/epic_gather_information.md)

* Create wireframes and prototypes: Create wireframes and prototypes that translate the design strategy and style guide into actionable visual representations. Use tools such as Figma or Adobe XD to create wireframes and prototypes that showcase the layout, navigation, and functionality of the web page. Get feedback from stakeholders and users and iterate the design until it meets the project's requirements and user needs.

* Develop the visual design: Develop the visual design of the web page by applying the design strategy and style guide to the wireframes and prototypes. Use tools such as Adobe Photoshop or Sketch to create high-fidelity designs that showcase the visual elements, typography, and color scheme of the web page. Ensure that the visual design is consistent across different devices and screen sizes. -->



## Test plan

* [Implement the design in code: Implement the design in code by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the web page. Ensure that the code is well-structured, maintainable, and optimized for performance. Use tools such as browser developer tools and automated testing to ensure that the web page functions correctly and meets the project's requirements and user needs.](epics/epic_structure_test.md)
